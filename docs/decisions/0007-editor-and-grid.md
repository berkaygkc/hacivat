# ADR 0007 — Editor and grid

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-11-14
- Scope: M3a (UI-EDIT-01 to -23, HV-GRID-01 to -05, -10, -16; R-M3-10, -11, -22, -36 to -38, -49)

## Context

M3a adds the SQL console's editor and the result grid, both written for Hacivat on GPUI (Zed's
GPL editor crates are never read or used):

- `hacivat-text`: a headless text core (rope buffer, change sets, anchors, selections, the
  editing model, IME state, display layout), with no GPUI dependency;
- `hacivat-ui-editor`: the editor view and its element, over a `LanguageService` the app
  provides (`hacivat-sql-editor`);
- `hacivat-ui-grid`: a database-agnostic grid model, one custom element with layered regions,
  the view, and a virtual list, over a `GridDataSource` (the app's result adapter).

Several tasks paint into the same editor element in the same wave, so the seams between them
are fixed before the work starts.

## Rule

Each M3a task that makes a choice in this area appends one section headed
`## m3a-tNN — <topic>` (append-only; a choice made in a fix round goes into the same task's
section before re-review). A section states the choice, the alternatives it rejected, and the
tests or bench numbers that hold it. Sections: Task 1b (seams), Task 19 (the shape-cache key),
Task 20 (the fast-scroll thresholds), Task 24 (the off-thread analysis, R-M3-22), Task 28 (the
preview rule).

## m3a-t01b — seams

**Editor seams with exact signatures and module-owned state (P11).** The element calls each
painting module through one function whose signature Task 1b fixed, and each module owns a state
struct that `EditorView` holds:

| Module | Seam | State | Fills it |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gutter` | `paint(&GutterCtx, ..)` | — | Task 28 |
| `marks` | `add`, `set_state`, `clear`, `on_commit`, `paint(&MarkStore, &GutterCtx, ..)` | `MarkStore` | Task 28 |
| `preview` | `paint_band(&BandState, &VisibleRows, ..)`, `set_override` | `BandState` | Task 28 |
| `scrollbar` | `paint(&ScrollbarCtx, &MarkStore, ..)` | — | Task 28 |
| `a11y` | `declare(&mut A11yState, &Snapshot, ..)`, `announce` | `A11yState` | Task 29 |
| `large_file` | `tier_for(..)`, `update` | `TierState` | Task 29 |
| `clipboard` | paste and copy entry points | `PasteState` | Task 27 |

`EditorView`'s public methods delegate in one line (`add_exec_marks` → `marks::add(&mut
self.marks, ..)`). Task 19 owns every call site in `view.rs` and `element.rs`; Tasks 27 to 29
own only their modules, so the parallel tasks never edit the same file. The band's state is
`BandState` because `PreviewState` is already the service's verdict enum. Rejected: methods on
`EditorView` filled by each task (three tasks editing `view.rs` in one wave). Task 1b's bodies
paint nothing and change nothing (`MarkStore`'s bookkeeping works, so the app can be written
against it).

**The language service fails closed.** `LanguageService::exec_preview` returns
`Option<ExecPreview>`; the editor's default service (`FailClosedService`) and Task 1b's
`SqlLanguageService` never preview or offer a range (`fail_closed_service_never_previews_a_range`),
so Run cannot run text the user was not shown.

**`hacivat-text` stays headless.** `check-deps` rule `TextCoreNotHeadless` fails the build when
`hacivat-text` reaches `hacivat-ui-core` or `gpui`, so the text core's tests run without a
window and the editing model can be fuzzed.

**Commands and keys.** The editor, grid and console key rows are bound in Task 1b's keymap
blocks before their commands exist (a binding to an unregistered command does nothing); the
app's `keymap_commands_are_registered` test lists them as M3a pending, and the list is emptied at
the M3a gate. GPUI's key parser has no Break key, so `exec.cancel` is `cmd-.` on macOS (French
layout `cmd-shift-.`) and `ctrl-f2` on Windows and Linux (and in the DataGrip preset); the
`ctrl-break` row of R-M3-38 is not bound. The Edit menu group shows only once `editor.*`
commands are registered, and its clipboard items carry no key equivalent, so the menu never
takes `cmd-c`/`cmd-v` from a focused text input.

**App seams.** A console tab's view comes from the `console_view` hook (built once per tab, its
root takes the content area as the M2 home does), its decoration (title, environment mark, the
1 px production hairline) from `tab_decor`, the results tile from `results_view`; closing a tab
and quitting ask `tab_close_guard` and `quit_guard`, which may defer (the guard later calls
`Workspace::force_close_tab` or quits). Every empty or stub hook keeps today's rendering, so the
M1 and M2 shots do not move.
