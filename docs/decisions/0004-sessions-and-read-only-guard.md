# ADR 0004 — Sessions and the read-only guard

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-11-13
- Scope: M2b (HV-SESS-01 to -08, HV-CONN-04, -05, SQL-SAFE-05, MCP-09 step 1, D-035)

## Context

M2a holds one connection per profile and labels read-only connections without enforcing them
(R10). M2b turns connections into sessions:

- a session actor per connection, with a request queue, transaction state, a cancel ladder,
  environment replay and schema tracking;
- a `SessionManager` per profile that routes requests to the default session, client
  sessions, pools and jobs;
- liveness and reconnect with an honest account of the state a reconnect loses;
- a read-only guard in layers per engine (`hacivat-guard`, sans I/O), a role probe and an
  access label that never claims more than the server enforces.

These choices decide what a user's statement can do to their database, so every one is
recorded here by the task that makes it.

## Rule

Each M2b task that makes a choice in this area appends one section headed
`## m2b-tNN — <topic>` (append-only; a choice made in a fix round goes into the same task's
section before re-review). A section states the choice, the alternatives it rejected, how it
fails closed, and the tests (or bypass-suite results) that hold it. Topics, in the order of the
plan: the actor model, transaction state, the cancel ladder, the reconnect policy, the guard
layers per engine, the labels, the role probe and the bypass-suite results.
